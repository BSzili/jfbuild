With contributions by Ken Silverman

ReadMe Information


First Source Release: 9 March 2003
This Release:         13 October 2004



A Few Notes and Words
---------------------
	This is a release of the source code to my port of Ken
Silverman's Build game engine [1]. The port intends to bring the engine
source up to speed so that it may be used more easily with modern
operating systems on the x86 platform, like Microsoft Windows and *nix-
like ones such as Linux and BSD.
	WinBuild is the name I give to the Windows target of this port.
It uses native Windows APIs like DirectX and the GDI to provide close
interaction with Windows for the sake of performance.
	I have also developed a more platform-independant layer for
use on systems other than Windows by way of the Simple Direct-media
Layer (SDL) [2]. This layer should assist as a basis for further system
ports or for easier implementation on the platforms SDL supports.
	Work on this port is a continuing process. I welcome the
contributions of programmers who have something they'd like to add (or
fix).


Configuration
-------------
	Runtime settings for BUILD.EXE and GAME.EXE are set in build.cfg
and game.cfg respectively. These files are normal text files.  The
original SETUP.DAT that is used in Ken's original code is not used in
this port. Details of the configuration options may be found in the
supplied copies of build.cfg and game.cfg.


Building the Source
-------------------
	I build the Windows binaries using the following tools and libraries:
	 * GCC 2.95.3-8 MinGW port (http://www.mingw.org)
	 * NASM 0.98.34 (http://nasm.sourceforge.net/)
	 * Binutils 2.13.90 MinGW port (http://www.mingw.org)
	 * MinGW Runtime 2.2 (http://www.mingw.org)
	 * W32API 2.0 (http://www.mingw.org)
	 * DirectX 6 headers and import libraries
	   (http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/common/directx-devel.tar.gz)
	 * SDL 1.2.3 (http://www.libsdl.org)
	   SDL is only used for the SDL interface layer and may be
	   omitted if building the DirectX version.
	 * FMOD 3.60 (http://www.fmod.org)

	Some good MinGW guides and whatnot:
	 - http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/mingw32/README.txt
	 - http://www.spacejack.org/games/mingw/

	The engine compiles under Linux and game.exe runs satisfactorily.
GCC 3.x requires a couple of compilation options changed. See the
makefile for what to do.
	Building the source involves just typing "make" in the directory
where you have unpacked the source. Windows users should make sure the
directory structure in the ZIP is maintained on extraction. The default
interface layer on Windows is the DirectX interface. This can be overriden
to the SDL one by using the command "make RENDERTYPE=SDL" instead. Linux
builds will always use SDL.

	As of 11 September 2003 the engine is also able to be built using
OpenWatcom 1.0. To compile for OpenWatcom I use the DirectX 7a SDK libraries
and header files supplied by Microsoft in the DX7a SDK. To compile the
KenBuild game you will also need the FMOD audio library.

	Also, as of 11 September 2003 the engine may be compiled entirely
from C source. See the notes in the Makefiles for more information on how
to set up to build from the C versions of things.


Things Missing
--------------
	So far the only thing missing is networking code. I'm working on
that. It's coming Real-Soon-Now.


Bugs and Whatnot
----------------
	A detail of the bugs fixed in this release can be found by looking
in the ChangeLog file.
	I'm sure during my hacking I've perhaps introduced a bug here or
there. I want to try and nail these as I can. If you think you've found
a bug I would certainly like to hear about it. If you get it to crash,
a crash dump would be extremely helpful. Contact me using the details
found below.

Credits and Thanks
------------------
*	Ken Silverman for his patience, help, and guidance in this. I
realise my rambling is taxing but your wisdom is invaluable.
*	The folks at icculus.org for inspiring me to try and equal their
work done in the first public port of the engine.
*	Do I dare mention myself?
*	Pimping the edgenetwork (http://www.edgenetwk.com) who host my
site wouldn't go astray.


Can't think of anything else at the moment, so, enjoy!
